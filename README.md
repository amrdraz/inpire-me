#Inpire ME

This is a simple inspriational quote generation app designed as a starting assignment for CSEN603

It's a work in progress but we could work with it I assume

The idea is to write some tests in mocha that test the quote generator
index.js is a server that will server index.html if you visit the url `/` or `/index.html`
if you visit `/quote` a random quote is served to you.

###TODO

Do server side rending
Make it look pretty
Set it up as a fornt end app
Enable CRUD API with mongodb
